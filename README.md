Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

Main Python file (app.py): Contains all application logic.

Database file (database.db): Stores user and student data.

Templates folder: Contains HTML files for rendering pages.

Static folder: For storing static assets like CSS or JavaScript (optional).

how to run this:-
  
To run the Flask project you've created, follow these steps:

1. Ensure You Have the Required Software Installed
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python: Version 3.x (preferably Python 3.6 or higher).

Flask: If you haven’t installed Flask yet, you can do so using pip.

Flask-WTF: For form handling and validation.

You can install Flask and Flask-WTF using pip if they are not already installed:

bash
pip install Flask Flask-WTF
2. Set Up Your Project Structure
Ensure your project structure looks like this:

text
PythonProject/
├── app.py                # Main application file
├── forms.py              # Contains LoginForm and SignupForm classes
├── database.db           # SQLite database file
├── templates/            # Folder for HTML templates
│   ├── home.html         # Home screen template
│   ├── login.html        # Login page template
│   ├── signup.html       # Signup page template
│   ├── batch_students.html  # Batch students page template
└── static/               # Folder for static files (optional, e.g., CSS/JS)
3. Initialize the Database
Before running the application, ensure that your database is set up correctly. If you haven't already done so, add the database setup code to create necessary tables in app.py or a separate script.

If you used the setup_database() function provided in earlier steps, make sure to call it before starting your application:

python
setup_database()  # Call this function to create tables if not already created.
4. Run the Application
To run your Flask application, follow these steps:

Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
Navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located.

Set Environment Variables:
Depending on your operating system, set the environment variable for Flask.

On Windows:

bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development  # Optional: Enables debug mode for development
On macOS/Linux:

bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development  # Optional: Enables debug mode for development
Start the Flask Development Server:
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
flask run
5. Access Your Application
Once the server is running, you should see output similar to this in your terminal:

text
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access your application.

6. Testing Your Application
You should see your home page.

Click on "Login" to access the login form.

Click on "Sign Up" to access the signup form.

Test the functionality by entering valid and invalid data.

7. Stopping the Server
To stop the Flask development server, simply go back to your terminal and press CTRL+C.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run and test your Flask project with login, signup, and batch functionalities! If you encounter any issues, please check for error messages in your terminal for debugging information.
